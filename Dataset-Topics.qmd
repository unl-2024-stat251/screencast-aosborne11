Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- Individual country comparison, No. Medals won by each country
- Athlete age analysis, do younger athletes perform better? Or do Olympians get better with age?
- Any gender disparity that may exist within the distribution of medals

Stat 251 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Cleaning the data with dplyr verbs
2. Visualizing the data effectively 
3. Work with strings
4. Reshaping the data
